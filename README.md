## View the app:
Note: Because we are using the Render free tier, the app is subject to a cold start so it might take a while to load or respond with a 502 error at first. Also, the linux executable for fluidsynth is not compatible with our app, so the generated sound files in the deployed environment will sound different than the ones generated on my Mac stored as “Favorites”.
